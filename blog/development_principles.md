# Development Principles

## Coding
### Borrow code liberally, but understand how and why it does what it does

### Never be more than 10 lines of code away from being able to execute/test your code

### Take the time to make executing and testing your code trivial

### Knowing how to arrive at the answer is sometimes more valuable than knowing the answer itself

## Troubleshooting
### Learn to isolate the lowest common denominator


## Communication
### Practice adapting your message to your audience

### Don't underestimate pictures


## Learning/Professional Development
### Practice reading unfamiliar code

### Look for opportunities to learn a new technology
