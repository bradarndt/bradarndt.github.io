# Development Principles
Borrow code liberally, but understand how and why it does what it does

Never be more than 10 lines of code from being able to execute/test your code

Take the time to make executing your code trivial

Knowing how to arrive at the answer is sometimes more valuable than knowing the answer itself

Practice adapting your message to your audience

Don't underestimate pictures

Learn to isolate the lowest common denominator

Practice reading unfamiliar code

Look for opportunities to learn a new technology
